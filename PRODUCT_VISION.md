# Sabot - Product Vision

## Overview

Sabot is a trust and safety platform designed to protect peer-to-peer transactions across online marketplaces. It acts as a verification and escrow-like intermediary that uses AI-powered analysis, identity verification, and real-time monitoring to reduce fraud and ensure safe exchanges.

## Core Mission

Enable safe, transparent, and verified transactions between strangers on online marketplaces by providing blockchain-like transaction transparency, AI-powered fraud detection, and real-time safety features.

## Platform Features

### 1. User Onboarding & Verification

**Authentication**

- Email-based authentication via better-auth
- Secure session management

**Homepage - Public Transaction Ledger**
The homepage functions as a blockchain-style public feed displaying all confirmed transactions:

- Unique Transaction ID
- Transaction type (electronics, services, fashion, etc.)
- Blurred names of verified buyer & seller (privacy-protected)
- Timestamp

**Trust Score System**

- Each successful transaction contributes to a user's Trust Score
- Trust Score measures reliability and verified transaction history
- **Critical**: Trust Score is **only visible to buyers** viewing a seller's profile
- Not visible to sellers themselves (prevents manipulation)
- Helps buyers assess seller credibility through verified transaction patterns

**Verification Requirements**
Users must complete verification to access full platform features:

1. **Government ID Upload** - OCR-verified for authenticity
2. **Live Face Recognition** - Face match against uploaded ID
3. **Verified Status** - Unlocks transaction and AI security features

---

### 2. Invite Counterparty

**Transaction Link Generation**

- Either party (buyer or seller) can generate a unique Sabot transaction link
- Link can be shared via external platforms (Facebook Marketplace, Carousell, Instagram, etc.)

**Access Control Logic**
When an invitation link is opened:

- **Unauthenticated users**: Prompt to sign in
  - Display: _"Sign in to engage in a transaction."_

- **Authenticated but unverified users**: Prompt to complete verification
  - Display: _"Get verified to engage in a transaction."_

- **Both users must be verified** before proceeding to Transaction Preview Mode

---

### 3. Transaction Preview & AI Summary

**Upload Phase**

- Both parties upload screenshots of their conversation from the original platform
- AI automatically detects platform type based on text and visual patterns
- Each user can see if counterpart has uploaded (but cannot view the screenshots directly)
- Ensures confidentiality while maintaining transparency

**AI Processing Phase**
AI cross-references both conversation uploads to:

- Detect edited or mismatched message threads
- Identify missing messages or inconsistencies
- Highlight specific discrepancies

**Inconsistency Handling**
If discrepancies are found:

- System highlights specific messages missing on either side
- Transaction summary generation pauses
- Both parties must re-upload correct/complete data

**AI Summary Generation**
Once screenshots are validated, AI generates a structured summary:

- Item or service description
- Agreed price
- Delivery or meetup details
- Warranties or conditions mentioned
- Identified platform (used for Market Comparison)

---

### 4. AI Market Comparison

**Timing**: Appears immediately after AI Summary and before Transaction Confirmation

**Process**

- AI identifies the platform from uploaded screenshots
- Analyzes current listings from the same platform
- Assesses pricing trends and potential scam indicators

**AI Insight Panel Displays**

- Market-average price for similar listings
- Percentage difference between current deal and market average
- Contextual advisory notes

**Example Advisory**

> _"Average price for similar gadgets on Facebook Marketplace: â‚±18,000. Current offer: â‚±12,000 â€” 33% below average, potential scam indicator."_

**Purpose**: Ensures users evaluate fairness and safety before confirming transaction details

---

### 5. Safety Suggestions

**Interactive Suggestion System**
AI generates contextual safety suggestions based on transaction analysis:

- "Ask for warranty"
- "Request live demo"
- "Confirm delivery method"
- Custom suggestions based on transaction type

**Acknowledgment Interface**
Each suggestion displays two light bulbs:

- ðŸ’¡ **Left bulb** = Buyer acknowledgment
- ðŸ’¡ **Right bulb** = Seller acknowledgment

**Flow**

1. One party agrees â†’ their bulb glows
2. Both parties agree â†’ both bulbs glow
3. Agreed suggestions move from **"Suggestion Tab"** to **"Transaction Details Tab"**
4. Marked as mutually agreed safety conditions

---

### 6. Transaction Mode

**Activation Requirements**

- Both parties completed verification
- AI review steps completed
- Transaction summary confirmed
- Required safety suggestions accepted

**Features**

**Real-Time Map Visualization**

- Enabled only if AI Summary detects face-to-face meetup
- Both users' live locations appear on shared map
- Each user can view own position and counterpart's position
- Coordinates safe meetup logistics
- Disabled for digital transactions (delivery/service-based)

**Emergency Contact Alerts**

- Users can register emergency contacts
- Auto-report triggers:
  - Inactivity
  - Distress signals
  - Abnormal behavior detection

**Transaction Confirmation Logic**

- Both users must confirm completion
- If only one party confirms â†’ Transaction Mode remains open
- After dual confirmation â†’ Grace period begins for dispute handling

---

### 7. Post-Transaction & Reporting

**Grace Period**

- Duration determined by AI (e.g., 3 days based on transaction type)
- Users can file reports for:
  - Defective goods
  - Unmet conditions
  - Fraudulent behavior

**Report Submission**
When a report is filed:

1. AI generates incident documentation (structured official format)
2. Automated forwarding to cybercrime or mediation agencies
3. Case tracking system activated

**Ticket Page**
Users can:

- Track case status (Open, Under Review, Resolved)
- View AI-generated summaries and updates
- Access evidence or message history attached to report
- Communicate with support or authorities

---

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Authentication**: better-auth with email/password
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- **AI Integration**: (To be specified - likely OpenAI/Anthropic for conversation analysis)
